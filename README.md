# Corewar_42

Corewar is the final project of the Algorithm branch of 42.

### First, what is Corewar ?

Core War is a 1984 programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called Redcode.

### How does it work ?

Well, the subject if separated in two distinct programs:

1. The first one is the Virtual Machine (also called Arena), where the warriors are to fight for victory.
2. The second one is the assembler of said warriors (also called asm), which is to turn into a binary file, any *".s"* file written in the Redcode langage.
